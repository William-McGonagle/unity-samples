A bunch of Unity Samples that allow jumpstarting of projects. These are all written in C# and are built to be independent of other modules. Since they are licensed under the MIT license, you can use them in any project that you would like. If you do this, please drop a pull request adding your game's name to this section of the README.md.

These modules are all built to be as high profile and flexible as possible. All of the functions are well documented, and all of the scripts have been thoroughly tested. That means that these scripts are not only for prototyping but are also for production. Many of them use high-performance optimizations, but if the code is not to your standards, or does not fit with your game, we urge you to edit the script and drop us a pull request.
